Function 1:

1. Create a function that will return the value
2. Multiply n by n+1
3. Divide the answer of step 1 by 2
4. Write a value in the brackets to represent 'n'
5. I chose 4
6. Therefore, 4x(4+1)/2 is 10
7. I put the print statement so it will print 10

Function 2:

1. Create a function to return the sum
2. For i in range, write 1 and n+1
3. Write a value in the brackets to represent 'n'
4. I wrote 4
5. Therefore, 1+1 5 times (5 because n+1 = 5) is 10
6. I put the print statement so it will print the sum

Function 3:

1. Create a function to return the sum
2. For i in range, write 1 and n+1
3. For j in range, write 1 and i+1
4. This means it will keep doing 1+1+1+1 until the i condition is satisfied
5. Write a number in the brackets to represent 'n'
6. I put 4
7. Put the preint statement so it will print the sum
